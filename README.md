# e-commerce-website
I built an E-commerce site making use of Django, HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 
This website is responsive and I made use of stripe test as my payment gateway. For this website to function you must pip install django, pip install stripe, e.t.c you can look at the requirement.txt file to have a look of packages you need to install for this webapp too function. Please note you can ignore installing Crispy forms as I did not make use of it for this project but it was installed in this project.

Please note I have added some pictures to show how this website will look if properly installed and initiated.
